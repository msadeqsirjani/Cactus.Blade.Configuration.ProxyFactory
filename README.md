The Cactus.Blade.Configuration library is built on **netstandard2.1**. This means it's compatible with .NET 5.x and up, .NET Core 2.x and up and traditional .NET 4.6.1 and higher. See the Microsoft [docs on .NET Standard compatibility](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-platforms-support).

For traditional .NET 4.6.1+, you also need to have a more recent version of NuGet installed (NuGet v4 and up), which comes out-of-the-box with the latest updated versions of Visual Studio 2019 and [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).
